# ATN Test

This is a test to see if I can get the Commodore Serial Bus working as a non-blocking, asynchronous I/O protocol. Since it features a lot of me noodling out ideas, I've written it using the *Entangled* literate programming system. Consult the `atntest.md` markdown file for a wonderful little article about the test; this then generates the various assembly files for the project.

At the moment, very much a work-in-progress -- doesn't do anything as of yet.
